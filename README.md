## Overview

The `reshttp` object includes all major HTTP status codes, from **1xx** (Informational) to **5xx** (Server Errors), with associated professional messages. These messages are designed to provide clarity and helpful information to both users and developers.
## Installation

### NPM
```bash
npm install reshttp
```
### PNPM
```bash
pnpm add reshttp
```
### YARN
```bash
yarn add reshttp
```
### BUN
```bash
bun add reshttp
```
## Usage

```typescript
import express from "express";
import reshttp from "reshttp";


console.log(reshttp.okMessage)
console.log(reshttp.okCode)

const app = express();

app.get("/example", (req, res) => {
  if (!req.query.id) {
    return res.status(reshttp.badRequestCode).json({status: reshttp.badRequestCode, message: reshttp.badRequestMessage});
  }
  res.status(reshttp.okCode).send(reshttp.okMessage);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
```

In this example:
- If `id` is missing in the query, it returns a **400 Bad Request** with a formal message.
- If `id` is provided, it returns a **200 OK** response.
